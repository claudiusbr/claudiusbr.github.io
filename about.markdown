Hi! I'm Claudius. I like to say I build things, but I think it would be more honest to say I start-but-do-not-finish them. You have just stumbled upon my first attempt at a Github page. If you are reading this up to one month after I created it, then there's a chance I will finish it ðŸ˜Ž. If it's now over a year since I built it, then this is an example of the things I have started but not finished ðŸ˜….

I wrote this thanks to Jekyll, and this is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for this theme (Minima) at GitHub:
